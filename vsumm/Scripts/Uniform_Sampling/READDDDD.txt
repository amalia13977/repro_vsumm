So the main code is in uniform.sh
that shit has expected output like:

- Scripts/Uniform_Sampling/uniform.py will generate frame_indices_uniform_15_1.txt.
- Scripts/Evaluation/evaluate.py will produce final_results_uniform_15.txt with the F-score. 

Urwell

and last, that evaluate.py ass need summe.py from ./Data to run
the result saved at Result/SumMe/Uniform_Sampling
